/* =================================================================
 * VTStartSampling, VTStopSampling and VTBindSamplingResults
 * =================================================================
 *
 * VTStartSampling enables users to configure and start local 
 * sampling from within their applications. The result is a .tb5 file that 
 * the users can open using VTune(TM) Performance Analyzer. The user can stop 
 * the collection by calling VTStopSampling. 
 *
 * VTStartSampling arguments
 *     VTUNE_SAMPLING_PARAMS *samParams : Sampling params structure that 
 *                                        is used to configuring sampling. 
 * 
 * VTStopSampling arguments
 *     bool bBindSamplingResults : A boolean flag to indicate whether
 *                                    the sampling results (.tb5) file 
 *                                    will be bound or not.
 *                                    
 * VTBindSamplingResults arguments
 *     char *tb5Filename            : Simple or absolute filename of a
 *                                    an raw tb5 filename. 
 *
 *
 *
 * RETURN Values : 
 *        Both VTStartSampling and VTStopSampling return 0 on SUCCESS
 *        and a non-zero value if there is an error.
 *        The returned value can be used to check for errors.   
 *        The error codes are defined above.
 *
 *        NOTE : VTAPI_MULTIPLE_RUNS is a non-fatal error returned by 
 *               VTStartSampling when all the events specified cannot be 
 *               collected in a single run. In this case, sampling is 
 *               performed on a subset of events specified by the user. 
 *               When this error is returned, the caller is expected to 
 *               call VTStopSampling to stop sampling.
 *               Caller can check the 'status' field of VTUNE_EVENT entries
 *               to find out which events were sampled. 
 *               (status & VTAPI_EVENT_SAMPLED) will be non-zero for 
 *               events that were sampled, and 0 otherwise.
 *
 * USAGE MODEL :
 *
 * The following example program shows the usage of these APIs.
 *
 * #include <stdio.h>
 * #include <windows.h>
 * #include "vtuneapi.h"
 * int main ()
 * {
 * 	
 *
 *    VTUNE_EVENT events[] = {
 *      { 1000, 0, 0, 0, "BRANCH_EVENT" },
 *       { 10000, 0, 0, 0, "Clockticks" },
 *     };
 *
 *    U32 numEvents = sizeof(events) / sizeof(VTUNE_EVENT);
 *    VTUNE_SAMPLING_PARAMS params = { sizeof(VTUNE_SAMPLING_PARAMS),
 *                                      sizeof(VTUNE_EVENT),
 *                                      0,
 *                                      0,
 *                                      0, 
 *                                      0, 
 *                                      1000, 
 *                                      40,    
 *                                      1, 
 *                                      numEvents, 
 *                                      events, 
 *                                      "xyz.tb5" };
 *
 *    U32 u32Return = VTStartSampling(&params);
 *
 *
 *    if (u32Return)
 * 	  { 
 *        // handle error ...
 *        exit(0);
 *    }
 *
 *    // user code
 *    ...
 *    ...
 *
 *	  u32Return = VTStopSampling(true);
 *  	if (u32Return)
 *    {
 *       // handle error...
 *		   exit(0);
 *    }
 *    ...
 *    ...
 *  } 
 *
 *
 *  LINK REQUIREMENTS :
 *
 *  The user program needs to link with VtuneApi.lib on Windows* and
 *  with libVtuneApi.so on Linux*. In addition, some dependent 
 *  libraries have to be in the path on Windows* and in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 *  on Linux*.
 *
 *  On Linux*, the user program also needs to link with libpthread.so.

/* =================================================================
 *		
 * VTPause and VTResume
 *
 * =================================================================
 *
 * VTPause and VTResume pause or resume data collection during a 
 * Sampling, Counter Monitor, or Callgraph activity.
 *
 * If VTPause is called while a Sampling collection is active, a flag 
 * is set which suspends collection of PC samples on the current machine. 
 * Collection of PC samples can be resumed by calling VTResume which clears 
 * the flag. The overhead to set and clear the flag is very low, so the 
 * VTPause and VTResume can be called at a high frequency.
 *
 * If VTPause is called while a Callgraph collection is active, 
 * Callgraph data collection is paused for the current process. Callgraph 
 * data collection for the current process can be resumed by calling 
 * VTResume.
 *
 * If VTPause is called while a Counter Monitor collection is active, 
 * Counter Monitor data collection is paused. Counter Monitor data collection 
 * can be resumed by calling VTResume.
 *
 * VTPause and VTResume can be safely called when the Sampling, Counter 
 * Monitor, and Callgraph collectors are not active.In this case, the 
 * VTPause and VTResume do nothing.
 *
 * NOTE:
 *
 * Sampling, Counter Monitor, and Callgraph activities are typically 
 * started with the VTune(TM) analyzer application. The VTune(TM) analyzer GUI 
 * allows Sampling, Counter Monitor, and Callgraph activities to be started in 
 *"Pause" mode which suspends data collection until a VTResume is called.
 * Data collection can also be paused and resumed by the Pause/Resume button 
 * in the VTune(TM) analyzer GUI.
 * See VTune(TM) analyzer onlilne help for more details.
